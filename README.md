This repository contains a collection of various filters used for state estimation in different applications. State estimation is a fundamental problem in many fields, such as robotics, signal processing, finance, and more. The goal is to estimate the true underlying state of a system based on noisy or incomplete measurements.

The filters included in this repository are implemented in Python and cover a range of filtering techniques commonly used in state estimation tasks. Each filter is designed to handle specific characteristics of the system and the measurement noise. The filters provided in this repository are as stated below.
