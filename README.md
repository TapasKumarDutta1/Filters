# General Overview
This repository contains a collection of various filters used for state estimation in different applications. State estimation is a fundamental problem in many fields, such as robotics, signal processing, finance, and more. The goal is to estimate the true underlying state of a system based on noisy or incomplete measurements.

The filters included in this repository are implemented in Python and cover a range of filtering techniques commonly used in state estimation tasks. Each filter is designed to handle specific characteristics of the system and the measurement noise. The filters provided in this repository are as follows:

Kalman Filter:
The Kalman Filter is a widely-used linear filter for state estimation in systems with Gaussian noise. It optimally combines measurements and predictions to provide accurate estimates of the system state. This filter is particularly effective for linear dynamic systems with Gaussian noise processes.

Extended Kalman Filter (EKF):
The Extended Kalman Filter is an extension of the Kalman Filter that can handle non-linear system models and non-Gaussian noise. It linearizes the system dynamics and measurements to apply the Kalman Filter principles iteratively. The EKF is useful for non-linear systems, but it may suffer from approximation errors for highly non-linear scenarios.

Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF):
The Unscented Kalman Filter is another extension of the Kalman Filter that addresses the limitations of the EKF. It uses a deterministic sampling technique called the unscented transform to capture the non-linearities more accurately. The UKF is suitable for highly non-linear systems and provides better performance than the EKF in many cases.

Particle Filter (Monte Carlo Filter):
The Particle Filter is a non-parametric filter that uses a set of random samples (particles) to represent the posterior distribution of the system state. It is well-suited for non-linear and non-Gaussian systems and can handle multimodal distributions effectively. The Particle Filter is particularly useful in scenarios where other filters struggle due to non-linear or multi-modalities in the state space.

Discrete Bayes Filter:
The Discrete Bayes Filter, also known as the recursive Bayes filter, is a general algorithm for state estimation based on Bayes' theorem. It discretizes the state space and updates the probabilities of different states based on new evidence (observations) and motion models. This filter is versatile and can be applied to a wide range of discrete state estimation problems.

Generalized Holt-Winters (GH) Filter:
The Generalized Holt-Winters Filter is a variant of the classical Holt-Winters method, which is commonly used for time-series data smoothing and short-term forecasting. The GH filter incorporates both trend and noise components to capture the underlying patterns in time-series data. It provides an effective way to handle data with trends and seasonal patterns.

The repository provides clear and well-documented implementations of each filter, along with usage examples and explanations of their strengths and limitations. Users can explore the different filters, understand their theoretical foundations, and choose the appropriate filter for their specific state estimation tasks.

Whether you are working on robotic localization, sensor fusion, financial modeling, or any application involving state estimation, this repository offers a valuable resource to explore, compare, and apply various filtering techniques to improve the accuracy and reliability of your state estimates.
