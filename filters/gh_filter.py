    Apply a 1D Generalized Holt-Winters filter to the input data.

    Parameters:
        data (list): List of data points to be filtered.
        g (float): Smoothing factor for the trend component.
        h (float): Smoothing factor for the noise component.
        dx (float): Initial estimate of the data point.
        dt (float): Time interval between data points.

    Returns:
        list: A list of filtered data points.

    The Generalized Holt-Winters filter is used to smooth time-series data and make
    short-term predictions. It consists of two components: the level (dx) and the trend (dx).
    The filter iterates through the data, updating the level and trend estimates based on the
    input smoothing factors (g and h) and the observed residuals. The filtered results are
    returned as a list.
